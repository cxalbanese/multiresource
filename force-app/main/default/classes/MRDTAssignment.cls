//MRDTAssignment Author: Chris Albanese, Version 1, Created Dec 16, 2021
//Purpose: Create assigned resource records for a collection of service appointments
//This class is currently not used as the flow was able to create the AR records directly
//Called by: Flow: MR_DT_Service_Appointment_Review
//Disclaimer: Use at your own risk: this code is provided as a concept illustrator to manage multiple service appointments for a work order
//Disclaimer: This code does not use the scheduling features of SFS and will produce scheduling violations on your Gantt
